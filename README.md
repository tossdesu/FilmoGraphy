# FilmoGraphy 
This is an app for movie searching and adding them to lists: liked, watched, will watch.
<br>
This is my small pet project to consolidate knowledge and skills in mobile development.
<br>
<br>
<b>At the moment added an ability to download film collections without detail info about each one. Now working on getting detail film info.</b>
